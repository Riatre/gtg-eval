    "initial": "You are playing a game called \"Guess The Game\". The rules are that 6 images are given in sequence. Each image is a screenshot from the same game, potentially sourced from official trailers or the internet. The images might not be full screenshots but rather a small area of a scene's screenshot.\n\nAfter seeing each image, you must guess what the game is based on the information in the image, provide its name in English, and wrap the name in <answer></answer> tags, for example: \"Given that, my guess is <answer>Donkey Kong</answer>.\". There should be exactly one answer tag in each of your response, only your answer for current round should be in answer tag, other game names (for example, when referring to your previous guess) should not be in answer tag. In each output, besides the game name, you may also provide some explanation and reasoning for your guess, to serve as a reference if you haven't guessed correctly and need to continue guessing.\n\nThe game's built-in instructions are as follows:\n\n---\n**How To Play Guess The Game**\nSearch for the game that you think the shown screenshot belongs to.\n\nAll 6 screenshots are from the same game.\n\nIf you get it wrong or click skip, we will reveal an additional screenshot of the game.\n\nYou get 6 guesses in total.\n\n**Feedback:**\n*   游릴 = Correct\n*   游린 = Incorrect\n*   游릳 = Correct Franchise\n\n**Example:**\n*   *Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto 4, Grand Theft Auto 5* would be the right franchise for *Grand Theft Auto 1*.\n*   *Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy Online, Final Fantasy 12* would be the right franchise for *Final Fantasy II*.\n*   *Super Mario Brothers, Mario Galaxy* would be the right franchise for *Paper Mario*.\n*   *Yoshi's Island, Super Smash Brothers, Donkey Kong* would *not* be the right franchise for *Paper Mario*.\n---\n\nFor each of your guesses, you will receive the next image and feedback on the correctness of your guess. The correctness feedback includes three possible outcomes: 游릴 Completely correct, 游릳 Your guess belongs to the same franchise as the answer, or 游린 Incorrect.\n\nThis is the first image.",
